Problem Statement:
Give an array 'arr' containing 'n' elements,rotate this array left once and return it.

Rotating the array left by one means shifting all elements by one place to the left and moving the first element to the last position in the array.

Example:
Input:'a'=5,'arr'=[1,2,3,4,5]
output:[2,3,4,5,1]

Python:

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, arr):
        temp=arr[0]
        n=len(arr)
        for i in range(1,n):
            arr[i-1]=arr[i]
        arr[n-1]=temp
