Given an array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, and each element appears at most twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

Note: You can return the elements in any order but the driver code will print them in sorted order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [2, 3] 
Explanation: 2 and 3 occur more than once in the given array.
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 2] 
Output: []
Explanation: There is no repeating element in the array, so the output is empty.

Python3:-
class Solution:
    def findDuplicates(self, arr):
        # code here
        seen=set()
        dup=[]
        for i in arr:
            if i in seen:
                dup.append(i)
            else:
                seen.add(i)
        return dup
